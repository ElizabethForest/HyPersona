# HyPersona

A semi-automated framework for persona development and the hyperparameter tuning of clustering algorithms.

## Motivation

Selecting the algorithm and parameters to use for a clustering problem, known as hyperparameter tuning, can be difficult.
HyPersona aims to similify the hyperparameter tuning process by applying an exhaustive grid search across a series of clustering algorithms and parameters, and uses thresholds to automatically rule out cluster sets. 
HyPersona then develops a series of graphs and CSV files to facilitate the selection of a clustering algorithm and parameters.

## Installation 

HyPersona is currently not available for installation as a library, however the source code can be downloaded and used. 

_TODO: set up with pip_

HyPersona requires:
- [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)


## Example Usage
