# Clustering Algorithms

There are numerous clustering algorithms out there, many of which are implemented in Python.
This page provides a brief overview/directory of where to find some of these algorithms already implemented.

Please feel free to make a PR if I've missed any :) 


## Available in this Project
- Kernel K-means
  - Available in this project based on the [gist created by Mathieu Blonde](https://gist.github.com/mblondel/6230787)
- Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF)
  - Implemented in this projected - extends NMF as implemented in sklearn for decomposition to apply it to clustering
